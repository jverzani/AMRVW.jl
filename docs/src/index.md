Implementation of core-chasing algorithms for finding eigenvalues of
factored matrices.

This repository provides a Julia package implementing the methods, as
applied to the problem of finding the roots of polynomials through the
computation of the eigenvalues of a sparse factorization of the
companion matrix in:

As well, the twisted algorithm from *A generalization of the multishift QR algorithm* by Raf Vandebril and David S. Watkins; [https://doi.org/10.1137/11085219X](https://doi.org/10.1137/11085219X) is implemented here.

The core-chasing algorithms utilize Francis's QR algorithm on sparse
factorizations of the respected companion matrix. For polynomials with
real coefficients, the storage requirements are ``O(n)`` and the
algorithm requires ``O(n)`` flops per iteration, or ``O(n^2)`` flops
overall. The basic QR algorithm applied to the full companion matrix
would require ``O(n^2)`` storage and ``O(n^3)`` flops overall.
